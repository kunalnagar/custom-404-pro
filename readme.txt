Override the default 404 page with any page from the Admin Panel or a Custom URL.

== Description ==

Allows users to replace the default 404 page with a custom page from the Pages section in the Admin Panel. Or you can specify a complete URL to redirect on 404.

= Important Note =

Please open [issues on Github](https://github.com/kunalnagar/custom-404-pro/issues). I will not be using the WordPress.org support area.

= Features =

* Full 404 Page Control
* Record 404 Page Data
* Custom Page Redirect
* Custom URL Redirect

= How does it work? =

* WordPress Page: Choose a custom page from the Admin Panel
* URL: Enter a custom URL for 404
* Stats: List of all 404s

== Installation ==

* Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
* Copy the custom-404-pro folder to the wp-content/plugins directory.
* Activate from the Plugins Section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the 404 custom redirect not working? =

Some users have reported an issue with the Divi theme where the 404 redirect does not work. In such cases, please disable the Divi theme and try again. It's usually a good practice to start disabling themes/plugins one by one and work your way backward to see what might be causing the issue.

= Why are my plugin preferences not being saved? =

Uninstall the plugin from the Plugins page (important!) and reinstall it. Never remove plugin folders directly from your WordPress installation as this DOES NOT cleanup plugin database tables.

== Screenshots ==

1. Activate the plugin from the WordPress Admin Panel

3. Global Settings
